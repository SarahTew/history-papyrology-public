<div style="padding-top:2em;"><p>MTPO-LABS is a website for staging experimental digital projects and digital tools for possible inclusion on the Mark Twain Project's main online resource, Mark Twain Project Online. We currently have five lab projects underway: a digital documentary edition of literary manuscripts held in the Mark Twain Papers, a digital archive of Twain's writings for newspapers and periodicals, an archive of Mark Twain Project critical editions, an archive of the correspondence, and a data analysis resource page. All of these projects supplement Mark Twain Project critical editions or offer digital tools for users to work with them. The digital documentary edition of the literary manuscripts supplement the three published critical editions of writings unpublished in Clemens's lifetime--Which Was the Dream (1966), Mysterious Stranger Manuscripts (1969), and Fables of Man (1972). We published these three volumes as electronic editions on Mark Twain Project Online in 2020. The project on Twain's writings for newspapers and periodicals supplements the two volumes of Early Tales and Sketches (1979). The electronic versions of critical editions of the writings and the correspondence are being staged on this lab site for migration to a new, updated version of Mark Twain Project Online. The preparation of new resources on this lab site entails the creation of digital facsimiles in accord with national archive standards, the preparation of diplomatic transcriptions using the Projectâ€™s plain-text transcription guidelines (for letters and literary manuscripts), and the XML (Extensible Markup Language) of those transcriptions according to TEI (Text Encoding Initiative) standards. We created this labs site using the Hugo static site generator, a customized Hugo theme, and our own TEI/XML, XSL, CSS, and JavaScript.</p></div>
