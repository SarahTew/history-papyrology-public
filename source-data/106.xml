				<lb/>My dear <persName ref='Q76338502' n='Smyly, J. Gilbart' key='Smyly'>Smyly</persName>
				<lb/>You will ahve seen the news
				<lb/>of Grenfell&apos;s departure. It came as
				<lb/>a bit of a shock, as the latest
				<lb/>report had been better, and he
				<lb/>had lately written some postcards
				<lb/>(perhaps you had one), and said
				<lb/>he might/should? be expected in <placeName ref='Q34217' n='Oxford' key='Oxford'>Oxford</placeName>.
				<lb/>Well, he is coming, though not
				<lb/>as he intended, poor chap. I
				<lb/>dont think there was any longer
				<lb/>a real hope of recovery, and so
				<lb/>one can hardly regret t??e the?
				<lb/>end has not been long delayed.
				<lb/>The funeral is to take place
				<lb/>here on Saturday.
				<lb/>By his will, made in 1907, he
				<lb/>bequethed to you the papyri ob-
			</ab>

				<lb/>tained by him from <placeName ref='Q1555240' n='Gurob' key='Gurob'>Gurob</placeName> in 1894-5.
				<lb/>I see that in your preference to
				<lb/>&quot;???le papyri from <placeName ref='Q1555240' n='Gurob' key='Gurob'>Gurob</placeName>&quot; you say 
				<lb/>that this customary had been
				<lb/>&quot;given&quot; to you: did you use &quot;give&quot;
				<lb/>in the full sense of the word, I
				<lb/>wonder, and if so, was this gift
				<lb/>subsequent to the will? You see,
				<lb/>there is the question of proobate; if
				<lb/>a valuation and duty can be
				<lb/>escaped, so much the better of
				<lb/>course.
				<lb/>While there was still a possi-
				<lb/>bility that <persName ref='Q822668' n='Grenfell, Bernard Pyne' key='Grenfell'>Grenfell</persName> might one
				<lb/>day return work, I deliberately
				<lb/>????? aside the publication of
				<lb/><rs n='The Tebtunis Papyri, Part 3' key='Tebtunis III'>Tebtunis III</rs>, but now I shall
				<lb/>have to face it though being
				<lb/>in the mind ??? of other things I
				<lb/>can do nothing for as present at
				<lb/>any rate. I think that he

				<lb/>Have you still at <placeName ref='Q1761' n='Dublin' key='Dublin'>Dublin</placeName> any
				<lb/>part of it, or <del rend='strikethrough'>of</del> other carton-
				<lb/>nage from our diggings ? (I don&apos;t
				<lb/>want them : merely for information )
				<lb/>I hope that you flourish.
				<lb/>The summer term here has
				<lb/>been much upset by the strike,
				<lb/>of course, but the men are
				<lb/>all back at work again now.
