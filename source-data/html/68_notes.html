His correspondence from the Oxyrhynchus excavation is thus labelled "Beni-Mazar" (the location of the closest postal facilities) and not "Behnesa." Here Grenfell gives two locations, possibly because he was uncertain whether the first had postal service. "Kafr Meir" presumably corresponds to Kafr 'Amira, ca. 8 km southwest from Grenfell and Hunt's campsite at ar-Rūbīyāt (so Google Maps; consulted 1 1 November 2016). "Edwa" is al-'Idwa, ca. 14.5 km southwest of Rüblyät; though its post office seems to have been constructed only in 1905 (cf. W. Garstin, <i>Report upon the Administration of the Public Works Department in Egypt for 1905</i> [Cairo 1906] 108), its presence on a rail line suggests access of some sort to mail service. Garstin writes of the post office as "available for other villages."

In his letter to Smyly, Grenfell is presumably referring to the "numerous well-tombs of the early Ptolemaic period" (p. 4) and the cemetery "[n]ear the town on the north-west ... of a later period (second or first century B.C.)" (p. 5). In the EEF report, it is only in connection with the first of these <i>nekropoleis</i> that mummies are counted; the tombs there had "one or more chambers, each containing sometimes one or two, often five to ten." For all four cemeteries, see further M. Capasso and P. Davoli, eds., <i>Soknopaiou Nesos Project I (2003-2009)</i> (Pisa 2012) 16 (noting also p. 11). Smyly 's Hellenistic interests may account for Grenfell' s silence about the other work that was undertaken at or near the site; see "Excavations," 1900-1901 (n. 3) 5-6.

The EEF report indicates that the cemetery in question is near "Manashinshâneh" ("perhaps [ancient] Tanis," p. 6); for this location and further discussion, see P. Davoli, <i>L'archeologia urbana nel Fayyum di età ellenistica e romana</i> (Naples 1998) 165, and K. Muhlestein and B.

Keenan, "Deserted Villages: From the Ancient to the Medieval Fayydm," BASP 40 (2003) 138 (on Old Shāna and New Shāna). Hunt's packing list (n. 8) curiously makes no mention of "Manashinshâneh"; it may be that the objects recovered there are subsumed in the "Rubayyat" listing. "Fourth": Grenfell is counting sites with Ptolemaic <i>nekropoleis</i>, not individual cemeteries.

Merlin, "Notice sur la vie et les travaux de M. Pierre Jouguet, membre de l'Académie," <i>Comptes rendus des séances de V Académie des Inscriptions et Belles-Lettres</i> 94 (1950) 392-406. The cemetery "about six miles away" - Google Maps (consulted 16 November 2016) indicates that the distance is actually about 6 km - was Kõm Medinet GuTān. Jouguet, "Fouilles du Fayoum: Rapport sur les fouilles de Médinet-Mâ'di et Médinet-Ghôran," BCH 25 (1901) 384-385, describes the impetus for his "change of venue" as follows: "Le nazir d'une esbeh voisine m'avait apporté les débris d'un sarcophage et un fragment de cartonnage en papyrus, où par une déchirure on lisait quelques mots d'un document grec. Il était clair qu'ils provenaient d'un cimetière de la région. Il fallait donc avant tout découvrir ce cimetière et l'arracher aux pillards. Des bédouins qui travaillaient à la fouille me conduisirent presque aussitôt à Médinet-Ghôran.

Grenfell's "1903" is echoed in a letter to Smyly of 5 May 1901 (IE TCD MS 4323, no. 46). In the event, he and Hunt would not publish any of the papyri from their 1900/1901 excavations. According to MS 4323, no. 46, the number of good or fair "papyrus mummies" recovered during the season was about 30, "besides pieces of many others."
