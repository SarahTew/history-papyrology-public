				<lb/>My dear <persName ref='Q76338502' n='Smyly, J. Gilbart' key='Smyly'>Smyly</persName>
				<lb/>How is <rs ref='Q60205087' n='The Flinders Petrie Papyri, Part III' key='Petrie III'>P.P.III</rs> getting on? I
				<lb/>do hope it is on the point of coming out at last. We
				<lb/>shall not lightly forgive you, if we have to do the
				<lb/><placeName n='El Hiba' key='Hibeh'>Hibeh</placeName> volume without its assistance. Kengin quite
				<lb/>refused to believe when I arrived him that this
				<lb/>winter would see its appearance.
				<lb/>We managed to scramble through the texts of
				<lb/><rs n='The Tebtunis Papyri, Part 2' key='Tebtunis II'>Tebtunis II</rs> except the Dictys fragment) before we
				<lb/>left. Some day you might look through the proofs,
				<lb/>if you have time; but as the appendices have
				<lb/>still to be written and the volume isnt to appear
				<lb/>till far on in 1906, you had better see the reviewed
				<lb/>proofs. We returned to <placeName ref='Q79' n='Egypt' key='Egypt'>Egypt</placeName> to find everyone
				<lb/>[???] scheming to get hold of some of the surplus set
				<lb/>free by the <rs ref='Q464399' n='Entente Cordiale' key='Entente'>Anglo-French Agreement</rs>. Those
				<lb/>who have got posts are trying to get their salaries
				<lb/>raised, those who havent are intriguing to
				<lb/>obtain them. All the government &amp; Cmerts are
				<lb/>being reenganiered, the museum among the rest.
				<lb/>Whether any good will come out of it may be

				<lb/>doubted. That sucking papyrologist, <persName ref='Q937528' n='Lefebvre, Gustave' key='Lefebvre'>Lefebvre</persName>,
				<lb/>has been made an inspector of antiquities, so
				<lb/>will be practically lost which is a pity
				<lb/>for he was at any rate capable of learning.
				<lb/>Another English inspector or two is to be
				<lb/>appointed, and a fly was thrown in our
				<lb/>direction, but needless to say was rejected with
				<lb/>scorn. It would take a very large bribe to
				<lb/>make us desert papyri now, and certainly
				<lb/>nothing could induce us to reside permanently
				<lb/>in this country, which is charming enough in winter
				<lb/>when one is far away by oneself, but is
				<lb/>intolerable in the haunts of the tourist
				<lb/>&amp; official. So we speed as swiftly as 
				<lb/>possible back here, and proceeded with
				<lb/>some qualms to knock down the [??lt]
				<lb/>door &amp; window of our house which had been
				<lb/>tricked up during our absence. To our
				<lb/>relief not tenants more serious than
				<lb/>spiders &amp; lizards (and 1 snake) appeared,
				<lb/>and we were ^<add place='above'>able</add> to settle down at once
				<lb/>without going through the usual ??ium
			</ab>
			<ab>
				<lb/>preliminaries of making an encampment.
				<lb/>The excavations proceed as before, with
				<lb/>practically the same set of men, who are pretty
				<lb/>expert by this time, though they require a
				<lb/>good deal of looking after (especially with
				<lb/>regard to the interecine disputes which
				<lb/>inevitably arise about the ownership of a
				<lb/>papyrus on [land??] the between two sets
				<lb/>of diggers) ; and this I have to do almost
				<lb/>unaided now, for my headman of former
				<lb/>years has been taken for a s?olding, and
				<lb/>his successor has not lung power enough
				<lb/>to cope with the rather turbulent inhabitants
				<lb/>of this village. We have now had nearly
				<lb/>a month&apos;s work and filled some 32 tons.
				<lb/>The first three weeks were not very exacting.
				<lb/>but the last week has produced some
				<lb/>quite fine 3rd century documents. Literary
				<lb/>fragments have been numerous in quantity
				<lb/>&amp; rather poor in quality — the best being
				<lb/>with unusual perverity <persName ref='Q6691' n='Homer' key='Homer'>Homer</persName>. Nothing
				<lb/>earlier than the 2nd century yet, but I hope
				<lb/>the mound we are going to begin tomorrow

				<lb/>may yield something earlier — though <del rend='strikethrough'>for</del>
				<lb/>Ptolemaic papyri one does not expect hire,
				<lb/>and even the Roman part is getting rather
				<lb/>exhausted now except where the ^<add place='above'>Roman</add> layers are
				<lb/>buried deep, ??d Byzantine and not much
				<lb/>use as far as papyri are concerned.
				<lb/><persName ref='Q18206796' n='Jouguet, Pierre' key='Jouguet'>Jouguet</persName> has not come out this winter. <persName ref='Q1309598' n='Rubensohn, Otto' key='Rubensohn'>Rubensohn</persName>

				<lb/><placeName ref='Q732908' n='Hermopolis' key='Hermopolis'>Ephunên</placeName> (<placeName ref='Q732908' n='Hermopolis' key='Hermopolis'>Hermopolis</placeName>) which was divided between

				<lb/>ground, but <persName ref='Q1309598' n='Rubensohn, Otto' key='Rubensohn'>Rubensohn</persName> appears to buy their
