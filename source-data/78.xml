				<lb/>My dear <persName ref='Q76338502' n='Smyly, J. Gilbart' key='Smyly'>Smyly</persName>,
				<lb/>Very many thanks
				<lb/>for the proof. You have done
				<lb/>a tremendous lot and it is very
				<lb/>kind of Barz to interest himself
				<lb/>in them. Plase give him our best
				<lb/>thanks. As to the ὦ φανεἱς χάρμα
				<lb/>piece, our first thought was that it was
				<lb/>cretis, but we abandoned it in deference
				<lb/>to <persName ref='Q77619' n='Blass, Friedrich' key='Blass'>Blass</persName> ; and it is too late to alter now

				<lb/>But your Phacthan idea in the
				<lb/>epigram seems a great improvement,
				<lb/>and we shall put that in all right. I
				<lb/>am most pleased however with your
				<lb/>remarks on 61 and 72 , in which you
				<lb/>have gone a long way to clear up
				<lb/>things . It is all the more welcome
				<lb/>for because after 4 months abr???
				<lb/>it is frightfully difficult to pick
				<lb/>up all the details again which are
				<lb/>necessary for a general thing, and I
				<lb/>still contemplate Appendix I with
				<lb/>horror. Appendix II (on <persName ref='Q3350' n='Ptolemy VIII Physcon' key='Ptolemy VIII'>Eureg. II</persName>)
				<lb/>is likely to be relegated into a
			</ab>
			<ab>
				<lb/>footnote and App. iii will
				<lb/>have to be short . It is no good [got?]
				<lb/>trying to get to the bottom yet
				<lb/>with the very scanty evidence and we
				<lb/>are under an obligation to get the
				<lb/>book out as soon as possible. At present
				<lb/>we are wrestling with the accounts,
				<lb/>which are simply infernal.
				<lb/>We are going to have an exhibition
				<lb/>of our miscellaneous anticas (<hi rend='underline'>not</hi>
				<lb/>papyri) with <persName ref='Q220130' n='Petrie, Flinders' key='Petrie'>Petrie</persName>&apos;s , so shall
				<lb/>have to go up to town about the end of
				<lb/>June for a few days. Otherwise
				<lb/>we shall sit very tight here till

				<lb/>December. The <orgName ref='Q1299166' n='Egypt Exploration Fund' key='EEF'>Fund</orgName> is clammoring
				<lb/>for another Oxyrhynchus vol. and we
				<lb/>have got to produce it before we go
				<lb/>out again. I hope you will be
				<lb/>able to pays us a visit
