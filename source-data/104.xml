				<lb/>My dear <persName ref='Q76338502' n='Smyly, J. Gilbart' key='Smyly'>Smyly</persName>
				<lb/>You will be sorry to
				<lb/>hear that I think <persName ref='Q822668' n='Grenfell, Bernard Pyne' key='Grenfell'>Grenfell</persName> is
				<lb/>getting into a rather dangerous
				<lb/>condition again. I gather that
				<lb/>he has been writing to <persName ref='Q2568204' n='Mahaffy, John Pentland' key='Mahaffy'>Mahaffy</persName>
				<lb/>&amp; perhaps to you also about
				<lb/>a proposed lecture in <placeName ref='Q1761' n='Dublin' key='Dublin'>Dublin</placeName>,
				<lb/>so it will perhaps be well for
				<lb/>me to give you a hint of how
				<lb/>things are. He is very active

				<lb/>???? for the Hib?y prelgins?
				<lb/>here, and is now in an abnormally
				<lb/>excited &amp; overwroght state of
				<lb/>mind full of all sorts of schemes,
				<lb/>some of a very impr???tiable.
				<lb/>He is just at the opposite pole
				<lb/>to the one at which you have
				<lb/>seen him sometimes; the two
				<lb/>things seem to ?lleate, first excite-
				<lb/>ment &amp; this depression.
				<lb/>It is of course possible, as I ????
				<lb/>with be the can, that no present
				<lb/>?Im?I has off without coming

				<lb/>not it would be well to promise

			<ab>
				<lb/>with regard to any lecturing
				<lb/>arrangements; in any case I
				<lb/>dont think these lectures do
				<lb/>him any good. So perhaps you
				<lb/>could manage to drop a discreet
				<lb/>word with <persName ref='Q2568204' n='Mahaffy, John Pentland' key='Mahaffy'>Mahaffy</persName> or whoever
				<lb/>is to manage it. ?wouldnt
				<lb/>?rad directly mention to the ?f?i?
				<lb/>as far as possible. I&apos;ll send
				<lb/>you a line alter to say how
				<lb/>things are going. g<persName ref='Q822668' n='Grenfell, Bernard Pyne' key='Grenfell'>G.</persName> is ????
				<lb/>for a day or two now.
				<lb/>I hope you got Ptolemy: but 
				<lb/>dont let me worry you.
