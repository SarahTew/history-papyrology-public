				<lb/>We had a very successful season on
				<lb/>the whole though we had very hard
				<lb/>luck in one respect. We found a
				<lb/>large cemetery of papyrus mummies like
				<lb/>the Gurob ones, but damp &amp;
				<lb/>imperfect mummification had reduced
				<lb/>the papyri to powder !
				<lb/>I was very glad to see <persName ref='Q2568204' n='Mahaffy, John Pentland' key='Mahaffy'>Mahaffy</persName>&apos;s
