				<lb/>My dear Smyly,
				<lb/>I ought to have written before
				<lb/>to thank you for your corrections on
				<lb/>the horoscopes, which were duly made.
				<lb/><persName ref='Q63413' n='Wilcken, Ulrich' key='Wilcken'>Wilcken</persName> discusses the matter in his
				<lb/>Gr. Ostraca (which I suppose you
				<lb/>have seen) but he doesnt seem to me
				<lb/>to understand it quite.
				<lb/>Cr??ius?? paid me a visit here a
				<lb/>fortnight ago and showed me copies of

			<ab>
				<lb/>some Ptolemaic papyri from Gebelen which
				<lb/>they have at <placeName ref='Q2966' n='Heidelberg' key='Heidelberg'>Heidelberg</placeName>. One had
				<lb/>a double date (this between mbres??)
				<lb/>the second year of Cleopatra (II) Soterina
				<lb/>(B.C. 129/8 according to <persName ref='Q63413' n='Wilcken, Ulrich' key='Wilcken'>Wilcken</persName>s
				<lb/>Gr. Ost I. 785), ξ[ανδικοσ] πεμπτη
				<lb/>= φαυρι πεμπη ; later on in the
				<lb/>same papyrus Peritius is Egypt [ADDITION]
				<lb/>to ?????. I am sorry you have
				<lb/>given up your th???? on the dates.
				<lb/>Perhaps this now we will be some
				<lb/>use. The change must have taken
				<lb/>place very shortly afterwards.

				<lb/>We have practically finished <rs>O.P.</rs>
				<lb/><rs>II</rs> and it will appear early in Nov.
				<lb/>It is unlucky for <persName ref='Q63413' n='Wilcken, Ulrich' key='Wilcken'>Wilcken</persName> that on
				<lb/>some points we shall put him out of
				<lb/>date. I suppose you have been
				<lb/>through his new readings on P.P.
				<lb/>If there is any thing you want me
				<lb/>to look at in the <placeName ref='Q34217' n='Oxford' key='Oxford'>Oxford</placeName> ones
				<lb/>let me know. We leave about
				<lb/>Nov. 5 to dig again in the <placeName ref='Q1399125' n='Faiyum' key='Faiyum'>Fayum</placeName>
				<lb/>and have another shy at those d-d
				<lb/>mummies.
				<lb/>We are publishing some nice Ptolemaic

				<lb/>papyri at <placeName ref='Q81788' n='Giza' key='Giza'>Gizeh</placeName> in <persName ref='Q63413' n='Wilcken, Ulrich' key='Wilcken'>Wilcken</persName>&apos;s new
				<lb/>Archiv, which he says will be out
				<lb/>in November (??). I will send you
				<lb/>an &quot;<foreign xml:lang='de'>Auszug</foreign>.&quot;
				<lb/>Remember me to <persName ref='Q2568204' n='Mahaffy, John Pentland' key='Mahaffy'>Mahaffy</persName> &amp; tell
				<lb/>him there have been many inquiries
				<lb/>for him here. I regret very much he
				<lb/>didnt turn up as usual this Sept.
				<lb/>I hope your book will be out soon. We
				<lb/>have been having a go at <persName ref='Q1347441' n='Revillout, Eugène' key='Revillout'>Revillout</persName>
				<lb/>on the ^ <add place='above'>subject of</add> marriage. He has completely misled
				<lb/>poor <persName ref='Q830421' n='Mitteis, Ludwig' key='Mitteis'>Mittias</persName>.
