				<lb/>How have you been

				<lb/>description indices etc. As usual
				<lb/>it has been an awful rush, we
				<lb/>shall reach nearly 400 pages this
				<lb/>time. I send for the proof of the
				<lb/>Horoscope . Would you mind seeing
				<lb/>if my representation of your view
				<lb/>is correct. I will also send
				<lb/>for proof of what I have written
				<lb/>on [GREEK] which comes in our
				<lb/>vol. I have endeavoured to keep
				<lb/>out of your way as much as
				<lb/>possible.

				<lb/>Are you nearly finished ? <persName ref='Q63413' n='Wilcken, Ulrich' key='Wilcken'>Wilcken</persName>&apos;s
				<lb/>ostraca as usually are expected
				<lb/>daily . It is really a judgement
				<lb/>on him that all the best papyri
				<lb/>from AhhnÃªs were burnt on
				<lb/>arrival at Hamburg ! Still
				<lb/>it was d-d rough on the poor
				<lb/>chap.
				<lb/>We are going to dig again
				<lb/>in the <placeName ref='Q1399125' n='Faiyum' key='Faiyum'>Fayum</placeName>. Before we start

				<lb/>collection, these two early xteen
				<lb/>things we got this time have
				<lb/>turned  up trumps.
				<lb/>We shall be paying a visit at
				<lb/>the end of Sept. to <persName ref='Q4262008' n='Lindsay, Alexander, 25th Earl of Crawford' key='Crawford'>Lord Crawford</persName>
				<lb/>at <placeName ref='Q208143' n='Wigan' key='Wigan'>Wigan</placeName> to look over hisi collection
				<lb/>If we had time, we should very,

				<lb/>shall be able.
