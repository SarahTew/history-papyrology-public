				<lb/>My dear <persName ref='Q76338502' n='Smyly, J. Gilbart' key='Smyly'>Smyly</persName>,
				<lb/>I was away in town yesterday, but
				<lb/>went to the <orgName ref='Q82133' n='Bodleian Library' key='Bodleian'>Bodleian</orgName> today, the light being some
				<lb/>of the best. Here are the answers to your questions
				<lb/>(1) <rs n='The Flinders Petri Papyri, Part II' key='Petrie II'>P.P.II</rs> vii line 7. I read εις τουτο for
				<lb/>εκ τουγ <hi rend='underline'>εις is quite certain</hi>. Παυνι in
				<lb/><persName ref='Q2568204' n='Mahaffy, John Pentland' key='Mahaffy'>M</persName>&apos;s copy isnt right.
				<lb/>line 11. the first symbol ῐ seems to represent
				<lb/>αρουρα, the second 5 artabae
				<lb/>13. I dont understand the symbol [symbol]. [cancellation?] 
				<lb/>[symbol] is of course ιπ(παεχια) or some other
				<lb/>derivative of ἵππος. But here the symbol seems
				<lb/>to be Μ not Π with an l through the middle.
				<lb/>(2) <del rend='overwritten'>R</del><rs n='The Flinders Petri Papyri, Part II' key='Petrie II'><add place='overwrite'>P</add> II.</rs>viii col II verso the word before
				<lb/>τιραχθηουσνται might be read as επει. In the
				<lb/>next line <persName ref='Q63413' n='Wilcken, Ulrich' key='Wilcken'>Wilcken</persName> is, I think, right: it is γαρ.

				<lb/>not Παρα and ιλικ<hi rend='underline'>οι</hi> What you took
				<lb/>for the second half of Ν is probably only
				<lb/>paint.
				<lb/>As for επιδανε]ζεσθαι I agree with you
				<lb/>ζ is unsatisfactory. ν]ιι̣σ̣α̣σθαι could be read
				<lb/>but it is more like λεσθαι
				<lb/>(3) II xiv (1a) 9.10 ως δ αν is right
				<lb/>he made a muddle of it first. ανενενεγ
				<lb/>καμενον will do. In this scrawl ον, ων
				<lb/>and αν are indistinguishable, but συνταγον
				<lb/>wont do. I am prepared to accept <persName ref='Q2568204' n='Mahaffy, John Pentland' key='Mahaffy'>M</persName>&apos;s
				<lb/>συντασσηι
				<lb/>(1b) He seems to have written ουση
				<lb/>first (perhaps he was going to unite ουσαν)
				<lb/>and then scratched out ου &amp; put in ο at
				<lb/>the top ἡ υγιης  is right. In the
				<lb/>next line τιπο̣ς̣ τ̣α̣ θ̣εμελε της can be
			</ab>
			<ab>
				<lb/>read. He certainly didnt write θεμελι<hi rend='underline'>α</hi>
				<lb/>but it is possible he inserted [greek] over the
				<lb/>line aftewrads, for the papyrus is rubbed
				<lb/>just at that point
				<lb/>(4) II xx col I 15 ο]θε̣ν is right.
				<lb/>(5) xxii 14. about 10 lettesr are lost
				<lb/>between χυραση̣ι̣ and απο. I cant see
				<lb/>any ει.
				<lb/>(6) XXVI (4) 2. the traces before ος will
				<lb/>do for ημ. Διμναιου of course is
				<lb/>right as in (3) 2,3 λι/μναιου του παρα
				<lb/>in (7) I should read τα χαλκου
				<lb/>[δε]αχμα[ς εξ[VERTICAL BAR] ηκοντα. But I dont
				<lb/>understand lines 5 and 6 where <persName ref='Q2568204' n='Mahaffy, John Pentland' key='Mahaffy'>M</persName>&apos;s readings
				<lb/>must be wrong. I suspect a mention
				<lb/>of αργυριον in line 6. n.6. in (8)
				<lb/>too there was probably a [pegmet] in both

				<lb/>silver &amp; copper. [???] are because of
				<lb/>a line below αεγ + εκα[τον.
				<lb/>Ptolemais ὅρμου is by the way
				<lb/>almost certainly at Illahun. Probably
				<lb/>the gurob papyri came from its very
				<lb/>cemetery.
				<lb/>Our boxes have come. <persName ref='Q220130' n='Petrie, Flinders' key='Petrie'>Petrie</persName> tells me
				<lb/>he only found about 25 papyrus mummies.
				<lb/>We have parts of 120 (about 60 well
				<lb/>preserved), so our collection ought to be
				<lb/>very large, though the pectarels etc are in
				<lb/>most cases somewhat smaller than the <placeName ref='Q1555240' n='Gurob' key='Gurob'>Gurob</placeName>
				<lb/>ones.
				<lb/>Tell <persName ref='Q2568204' n='Mahaffy, John Pentland' key='Mahaffy'>Mahaffy</persName> I am very sorry he wouldnt
				<lb/>come here.
				<lb/>Yours
