				<lb/>My dear <persName ref='Q76338502' n='Smyly, J. Gilbart' key='Smyly'>Smyly</persName>,
				<lb/>I propose to arrive on
				<lb/>Tuesday^<add place='above'>aft</add>. next by the rail (<placeName ref='Q7989013' n='Westland Row' key='Westland'>Westland</placeName>
				<lb/><placeName ref='Q7989013' n='Westland Row' key='Westland'>row</placeName>) It gets in about 5.30 p.m. I
				<lb/>think. On Wedn. I am dining with
				<lb/>the Provost.
				<lb/><persName ref='Q573778' n='Hunt, Arthur Surridge' key='Hunt'>Hunt</persName> &amp; I went through the Papyrus
				<lb/>with the results following.
				<lb/>Recto II 8 υπηρετου certain, but I do
				<lb/>not believe in κατ<hi rend='underline2'>ε</hi>πλεθσεν &amp; κατ<hi rend='underline'>α</hi>πλεθσε
				<lb/>is clear, the termination is so blurred that it
				<lb/>might be almost any thing.

				<lb/>III 2 Δημητριον is not possible
				<lb/>III 7 It is more like εισ than εκ, but
				<lb/>εκ could be read.
				<lb/>9. Πετενουριος is quite certain
				<lb/>12. There is a lacuna after επιγ[ and
				<lb/>it is <hi rend='underline'>not</hi> &apos;verhlebt&apos; now.
				<lb/>IV 8 <hi rend='underline'>σαν</hi> can be read, but so could <hi rend='underline'>σιν</hi>
				<lb/>(dots under the letters are reccuring anyhow)
				<lb/>The question depends on whether a vertical
				<lb/>stroke is ink o<del rend='overwritten'>f</del><add place='overwrite'>f</add> the original or with that
				<lb/>hes come off from the document gumred on
				<lb/>to it. W&apos;s reading makes better
				<lb/>greek than yours and we should prefer it.
				<lb/>Verso oII 2. W saw traces of ink where
				<lb/>his supposed ται would come, but they
				<lb/>are too slight to suggest any particular
			</ab>
			<ab>
				<lb/>letters and would do for σ̣ι̣ν̣ just as
				<lb/>well.
				<lb/>5. Τας επιπμ- is quote clear -α̣ς̣
				<lb/>doubtful but inevitable. Τασσεσθω
				<lb/>δε is very wide of the mark.
				<lb/>6 our reading is all right
				<lb/>I read, as you say, τ<hi rend='underline'>ο</hi> αργυριον
				<lb/>II των τ is clear, and in spite of
				<lb/>the speeing τ[οθς] σ[ταθμοθς is
				<lb/>necessary though your σ is very doubtful
				<lb/>πρυστιοεναι is right. <hi rend='underline'>υποτιθ</hi> cannot be read
				<lb/>15 your reading is certain
				<lb/>16. Here we much prefer W&apos;s
				<lb/>reading. it is as I said before,
				<lb/>Γ not Π and ΚΟΙ not ΚΟΝ
				<lb/>III 7. the drachme sign before ξ is
				<lb/>rubbed out, as you say.
			</ab>

				<lb/>By the way isnt your first setnece,
				<lb/>as you have corrected the proof, rather an
				<lb/>&apos;Irishism&apos;? Of course I understand your
				<lb/>meaning, but the oxymoron is a litte
				<lb/>violent for the unistructed.
				<lb/>In Recto II 10 we should prefer αυτον
				<lb/>to αυτων, the word in 12 is pretty
				<lb/>certainly an infinitive, μ̣η κατ̣α̣[βην]α̣ι̣
