				<lb/>Hotel Piora, <placeName ref='Q69265' n='Airolo' key='Airolo'>Airolo</placeName>, <placeName ref='Q39' n='Switzerland' key='Switzerland'>Switzerland</placeName>. June 24.
				<lb/>I have not been progressing so fast as I hoped and my docter
				<lb/>recommends me to stay in <placeName ref='Q39' n='Switzerland' key='Switzerland'>Switzerland</placeName> thorugh most of
				<lb/>July. So I shall not be at St. Andrews at their function. Is
				<lb/>there any chance of persuading you to come out and make a t???,
				<lb/>like that delightful one of last year? I am at present at <placeName ref='Q56033774' n='Val Piora' key='Piora'>Piora</placeName>
				<lb/>with two colleagues, who will be staying on for 10 days or a
				<lb/>fortnight: but I am not very much enamoured of this place and would
				<lb/>infinitely rather join you. I would suggest that, if you could
				<lb/>come out, the <placeName ref='Q204247' n='Zinal' key='Zinal'>Zinal valley</placeName> which is next to^ <add place='above'>the</add> <placeName ref='Q69551' n='Evolène' key='Evolène'>Evolene</placeName> ??, would
				<lb/>be an excellent one to explore. The station is <placeName ref='Q68297' n='Sierre' key='Sierre'>Sierre</placeName>,
				<lb/>next to <placeName ref='Q68136' n='Sion' key='Sion'>Sion</placeName>. I shall certainly leave this^place by July 34rd.
				<lb/>Yours ever <persName ref='Q822668' n='Grenfell, Bernard Pyne' key='Grenfell'>B.P.Grenfell</persName>
