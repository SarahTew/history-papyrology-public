				<lb/>My dear <persName ref='Q76338502' n='Smyly, J. Gilbart' key='Smyly'>Smyly</persName>, 
				<lb/>I hope &apos;Aey Kelly&apos; has reached
				<lb/>you all night. It lasted me as far as
				<lb/><placeName ref='Q623765' n='Rugby' key='Rugby'>Rugby</placeName> on a very pleasant journey, the sea
				<lb/>bring like a lake.
				<lb/>The <orgName ref='Q1299166' n='Egypt Exploration Fund' key='EEF'>Fund</orgName> agreed to our proposals without
				<lb/>discussion. They had been wrangling for
				<lb/>half an hour about Nautlr and <persName ref='Q1246324' n='Evans, John' key='Evans'>Sir John</persName>
				<lb/><persName ref='Q1246324' n='Evans, John' key='Evans'>Evans</persName>, not being a substitute to the <orgName n='Graeco-Roman Branch' key='GRB'>G.R.B</orgName>,
				<lb/>was too bored to discuss it. So I have

				<lb/>we shall proceed on the hypothesis that

				<lb/>I had a very pleasant [???] of a week
				<lb/>in turn, though not such as to effice
				<lb/>the memory of my <placeName ref='Q1761' n='Dublin' key='Dublin'>Dublin</placeName> visit. <persName ref='Q220130' n='Petrie, Flinders' key='Petrie'>Petrie</persName>&apos;s
				<lb/>show is well worth visiting, if only for
				<lb/>the Aegean pots warranted (by P.)
				<lb/>comtemporary with the 1st dynasty. I also
				<lb/>went to the <orgName ref='Q1327919' n='The Wallace Company' key='Wallace'>Wallace Collection</orgName>. The
				<lb/>French pictures are I suppose valuable
			</ab>
			<ab>
				<lb/>historically, but interested me less
				<lb/>than the Dutch and English, which
				<lb/>are superb. By the way is your

				<lb/>him and thank him for forwarding the
				<lb/>letter. He is, I understand, to pay

				<lb/>sorry I have not time to go down there too.
				<lb/>Thanking you even more for all your
