				<lb/>My dear <persName ref='Q76338502' n='Smyly, J. Gilbart' key='Smyly'>Smyly</persName>,
				<lb/>I arrived yesterday and
				<lb/>your notes on the <rs ref='Q21118630' n='The Amherst Papyri' key='Amherst'>Amherst papyri</rs> came
				<lb/>today. It is very good of you to have
				<lb/>taken so much trouble, and many thanks
				<lb/>for doing so. We will examine all
				<lb/>your suggestions carefully.
				<lb/>We didnt find much more after the letters
				<lb/>I wrote to you. But the mummy cases we
				<lb/>have got ought to make a fine volume
				<lb/>There are about <add rend='overwrite'>30 pap</add>yrus<ptr/> mummies
				<lb/>in good or very fair condition, besides pieces

				<lb/>of many others. Probably we shall
				<lb/>publish them in 1903.
				<lb/>I am sorry the crocodiles you have arent
				<lb/>more interesting, but <del rend='strikethrough'>We</del> I expect these we
				<lb/>have here are better. As to <foreign xml:lang='gr'>λαογραφία</foreign>
				<lb/>some of them, we know, are as late as
				<lb/><persName ref='Q1405' n='Augustus' key='Augustus'>Augustus</persName>&apos; reign and the ratio of 450:1
				<lb/>for copper &amp; silver belongs to that time
				<lb/>I dont think there is any doubt about
				<lb/>the ratio of 120 : 1 down to the end of the
				<lb/>2nd cent B.C. at any rate. <persName ref='Q213729' n='Brugsch, Heinrich Karl' key='Brugsch'>Brugsch</persName>&apos;s

				<lb/>papyri in the crocodile volume, which will
				<lb/>be big enough without them. So dont bother
				<lb/>about the <persName ref='Q1405' n='Augustus' key='Augustus'>Augustus</persName> ones, which are
				<lb/>palaeographically quite distinct from the
				<lb/>others and much more to read.
				<lb/>We went and saw the American man<ptr/> in
				<lb/><placeName ref='Q79' n='Egypt' key='Egypt'>Egypt</placeName> &amp; fixed matters up so far as
				<lb/>we could, but it is necessary for the
				<lb/>proposals to be ratifed by the
				<lb/>millionairess, from whom we expect a
				<lb/>cable shortly. If she is favourable
				<lb/>we hope to force the <orgName ref='Q1299166' n='Egypt Exploration Fund' key='EEF'>Fund</orgName> to accept
				<lb/>the crocodiles as this year&apos;s volume,
				<lb/>but the negotiations are rather ticklish
				<lb/>and <persName ref='Q2568204' n='Mahaffy, John Pentland' key='Mahaffy'>Mahaffy</persName>&apos;s ill-timed review of us<ptr/>
				<lb/>in the <rs ref='Q755237' n='Athenaeum' key='Athenaeum'>Athenaeum</rs><ptr/> hasnt helped
				<lb/>matters. However I hope things
				<lb/>will go straight and that we shall

				<lb/>be able to start work on the crocodiles
				<lb/>early in June. It will take us till then
				<lb/>anyhow to finish the <rs ref='Q21118630' n='The Amherst Papyri' key='Amherst Papyri'>Amherst <del rend='strikethrough'>[illegible]</del> papyri</rs>
