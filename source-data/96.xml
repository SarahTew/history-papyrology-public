				<lb/>Many thanks for your kind
				<lb/>invitation. There is nothing I should
				<lb/>like better than prolonging my stay

				<lb/>does not propose to come^.<add place='above'>(he wants to go to his people)</add> We both
				<lb/>look forward to coming next year
				<lb/>and staying some [litlte?] time, bringing
				<lb/>some papyri with us. But amid
				<lb/>the appelling distractions of the summer

				<lb/>in your interest as well as our it is
				<lb/>very important we should finish it as soon
				<lb/>as possible, so as to get on to the
				<lb/><rs ref='Q21118630' n='The Amherst Papyri' key='Amherst Papyri'>Amherst papyri</rs>, the publication of
				<lb/>which blocks the way to the
				<lb/>examination of our new finds So

				<lb/>convenient.
				<lb/><persName n='Schubart, Wilhelm' key='Schubart'>Schubart</persName> seems a great imporvement
				<lb/>on P. Meyer: though we look
				<lb/>forward to blowing them both up!
				<lb/>You remember the χαλκωρυχια in

				<lb/>in more ways than one.
				<lb/>My love to <persName ref='Q2568204' n='Mahaffy, John Pentland' key='Mahaffy'>J.P.M.</persName> But I
				<lb/>cant bring any papyri. It will be more

				<lb/>in Roman.
				<lb/>Yours very sincerely
