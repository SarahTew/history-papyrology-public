				<lb/>My dear <persName ref='Q76338502' n='Smyly, J. Gilbart' key='Smyly'>Smyly</persName>,
				<lb/>I was very sorry to
				<lb/>hear you were feeling overworked
				<lb/>though hardly surprised, as I feared
				<lb/>we took it out of you too much
				<lb/>in the summer. Of course we have
				<lb/>a reserve of fresh air to draw upon,<ptr/>
				<lb/>but it is very different with you .
				<lb/>You had certainly much better take
				<lb/>a good holiday this Xmas and not
			</ab>

			<ab>
				<lb/>worry about the infernal conundrums
				<lb/>such as land ἐν ἐπιστάσει. It would
				<lb/>have been nice to have had another
				<lb/>talk, but we must do the best
				<lb/>we can. There will still be
				<lb/>a loophole, for the introduction
				<lb/>to <hi rend='underline'>60</hi><ptr/> has been thrown overboard,
				<lb/>i.e. put into an appendix<ptr/> to
				<lb/>be written after our return (early in
				<lb/>April I hope). Perhaps, if the time
				<lb/>suits you will be able to pay
				<lb/>us a visit in April or we might
				<lb/>even come to <placeName ref='Q1761' n='Dublin' key='Dublin'>Dublin</placeName>; but it will
				<lb/>be a frightful scurry when we come

				<lb/>back, as I have now three<ptr/>
				<lb/>appendices to do and the index
				<lb/>will be a lively <del rend='overwritten'>g</del>job for H.
				<lb/>— and we have contracted to
				<lb/>bring out <rs n='The Oxyrhyncus Papyri, Part III' key='Oxyrhyncus III'>Oxyrhynchus III</rs> by
				<lb/>the end of 1902.
				<lb/>An Italian called <persName key='Salluzzi' n='Salluzzi, Paolina'>Salluz<add place='overwrite'>zi</add></persName> has
				<lb/>sent me a paper on prices in the
				<lb/>Ptolemaic period which is useful
				<lb/>and <persName ref='Q1436830' n='Svoronos, Ioannis N.' key='Svoronos'>Svoronos</persName> has been plunging
				<lb/>on Ptolemaic coins<ptr/>
				<lb/><persName ref='Q15996348' n='Ricci, Seymour de' key='Ricci'>De Ricci</persName> turned up here yesterday.
				<lb/>His last scheme is a corpus of
				<lb/>Latin papyri, which has more sense
			</ab>
			<pb n='3'/>
			<ab>
				<lb/>then another corpus of ostraca.
				<lb/>But he is quite mad.
				<lb/>Love to <persName ref='Q2568204' n='Mahaffy, John Pentland' key='Mahaffy'>Mahaffy</persName>.

				<lb/>Yours ever
				<lb/><persName ref='Q822668' n='Grenfell, Bernard Pyne' key='Grenfell'>B. P. Grenfell.</persName>
			</ab>
			<ab type='PS'>
				<lb/>P.S. Would you like 2 proofs
				<lb/>of the revises? If any idea of
				<lb/>the meaning of the section concerning
				<lb/>land ἐν ἐπιστάσει should occur
				<lb/>to you, I should be grateful. That
				<lb/>is the worst crux.
