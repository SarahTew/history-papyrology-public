				<lb/>My dear <persName ref='Q76338502' n='J. Gilbart Smyly' key='Smyly'>Smyly</persName>,
				<lb/>Many thanks for your
				<lb/>letter. I agree with a great deal of
				<lb/>what you say . χα 𐅂 β no doubt means
				<lb/>the equivalent of 2 silver dr. paid in
				<lb/>copper, though I think this implies
				<lb/>a more or less definite ratio between
				<lb/>silver and copper, like the ratio of 5 : 3
				<lb/>in <foreign xml:lang='grc'>πυρός</foreign> &amp; <foreign xml:lang='grc'>κριθή</foreign> The obol need not
				<lb/>be<del rend='strikethrough'>en</del> a coin, but I think it must
				<lb/>have connoted at any one moment a certain
			</ab>
			<pb n='2'/>
			<ab>
				<lb/>definite amount of copper (fixed
				<lb/>perphas in each year <del rend='overwritten'>[I]</del>(by the government)
				<lb/>and not <hi rend='underline'>merely</hi> a 1/6 of a silver dr,
				<lb/>for otherwise I dont see how any
				<lb/>sense is to be got out of saying that
				<lb/>e.g. 26 1/4 obols would be <del rend='overwritten'>ac</del> required
				<lb/>for a stater
				<lb/>As to the demotic 24 = 2/10 I have
				<lb/>had considereable correspondence with
				<lb/><persName ref='Q952574' n='Griffith, Francis Llewellyn' key='Griffith'>Griffith</persName> &amp; <persName ref='Q100547' n='Spiegelberg, Wilhelm' key='Spiegelberg'>Spiegelberg</persName> &amp; they quite
				<lb/>agree that it is a more translation of
				<lb/>the Greek and hasnt anything to do with
				<lb/>a ratio. According to <persName ref='Q952574' n='Griffith, Francis Llewellyn' key='Griffith'>Griffith</persName> it
				<lb/>should be translated &apos;copper 24 =2/10
			</ab>
			<pb n='3'/>
			<ab>
				<lb/>(of a silver deben) i.e. a stater, of
				<lb/>which there were 5 to a deben.
				<lb/>Provisionally it is perhaps best, as
				<lb/>you suggest, to simply substitute
				<lb/>2 chalci for an obol in ^ <add place='above'><rs n='Revenue Laws of Ptolemy Philadelphus' key='Revenue'>Rev Laws</rs></add> App. iii &amp;
				<lb/>keep the classification of <persName ref='Q3931858' n='Poole, Reginald Stuart' key='Poole'>Poole</persName>. But
				<lb/>the numismatists now say that his
				<lb/>weights arent to be trusted any more
				<lb/>than <persName ref='Q1347441' n='Revillout, Eugène' key='Revillout'>Revillouts</persName> . So that as far as
				<lb/>the 3rd cent B.C. goes, there isnt
				<lb/>really any direct evidence bearing on
				<lb/>the ratio at all , and we are still
				<lb/>quite in the air. And then what becomes
				<lb/>I <del rend='strikethrough'>do not quite understand</del> of the 480:1
				<lb/>ratio ?  The <placeName ref='Q1500580' n='Tebtunis' key='Tebtunis'>Tebt.</placeName> papyri give you
			</ab>
			<pb n='4'/>
			<ab>
				<lb/>every sort of ratio between 400 and 500
				<lb/>(<foreign xml:lang='la'>vide</foreign> especially the <del rend='strikethrough'>appendi</del> Descriptions)
				<lb/>I do not quite understand what you say
				<lb/>about the dr. of 7 obols being &apos;due to
				<lb/>the depreciation of silver&apos;. Do you mean
				<lb/>there were 2 kinds of silver tetradrachms
				<lb/>one worth 24 obols, the other 28? I have
				<lb/>never met the dr. of 7 obols before
				<lb/>the Roman period. Have you?
				<lb/>As for the ἐπαλλαγή I cant help thinking
				<lb/>that it must have something to do with
				<lb/>the relative value of the metals ,because
				<lb/>the charges for transport, baskets etc
				<lb/>are in <rs n='Notices et textes des papyrus du Musée du Louvre et de la Bibliothèque Impériale' key='P.Par'>P.Par</rs> 62. , all reckoned
				<lb/><hi rend='underline'>separately</hi> from the ἀλλαγή . But it is
				<lb/>curious that it is always about 10%. 
				<lb/>I am at present wrestling with App. i.
			</ab>
			<pb n='5'/>
			<ab>
				<lb/>Can you find any difference between our
				<lb/><del rend='strikethrough'>the</del> κάτοικοι and the κληροῦχοι of
				<lb/>P.P. except (1) the name (2)
				<lb/>the fact that the κάτοικοι were largely
				<lb/>recruited from the ἔφοδοι etc and therefore
				<lb/>might be originally Egyptians, though as
				<lb/><hi rend='underline'>32</hi> shows they became Greeks on becoming
				<lb/><del rend='strikethrough'>ca</del> κάτοικοι, and that there is no
				<lb/>evidence yet that the 3rd cent B.C.
				<lb/>κληροῦχοι were recruited in this sort
				<lb/>of way ?
				<lb/>Shall you be coming here this
				<lb/>summer ? <persName ref='Q2568204' n='Mahaffy, John Pentland' key='Mahaffy'>Mahaffy</persName> talks of doing
				<lb/>so, though I have warned him there
				<lb/>will be no 3rd cent B.C. papyri on
				<lb/>view till next year.

				<lb/>It would be nice if you could come
				<lb/>in July, for we shall be putting the
				<lb/>finishing touches then. Can you
				<lb/>send back the <del rend='overwritten'>a</del><add place='overwrite'>A</add>ccounts by June 10th?
				<lb/><persName ref='Q573778' n='Hunt, Arthur Surridge' key='Hunt'>Hunt</persName> is going away on the 13th
				<lb/>for 10 days , and with the
				<lb/>exhibition etc coming on things will
				<lb/>be rather disturbed until July 4th.
			</ab>

				<lb/>Yours ever
				<lb/><persName ref='Q822668' n='Grenfell, Bernard Pyne' key='Grenfell'>B.P. Grenfell</persName>
				</ab>

				<lb/>P.S. I hope by the way you wont mind my
				<lb/>having written the preface, and that you will
				<lb/>find the references to yourself satisfactory.
