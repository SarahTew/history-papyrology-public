				<lb/>My dear <persName ref='Q76338502' n='Smyly, J. Gilbart' key='Smyly'>Smyly</persName>,
				<lb/>I hope that you have now seen the
				<lb/>last of that index, and that <rs ref='Q60205087' n='The Flinders Petrie Papyri, Part III' key='Petri III'>P.P.III</rs> will be
				<lb/>out by the time we return. Have you tackled
				<lb/>these <placeName ref='Q1500580' n='Tebtunis' key='Tebtunis'>Tebtunis</placeName> cartonnages yet? I am curious
				<lb/>to hear if they turn out Greek or demotic.
				<lb/>We have been digging for 6 weeks now and are
				<lb/>just half way through the season. Though not
				<lb/>perhaps wildly exciting, the finds have been
				<lb/>quite good. We began by trying one group of
				<lb/>mounds which we avoided in 1897 and by clearing
				<lb/>away another mound in which good papyri
				<lb/>have been found near the surface, but in neither
				<lb/>case did we effect much more than demonstrate
				<lb/>the judiciousness of our previous action or inaction.
				<lb/>Then we made some biggish <add rend='overwrite'>h</add>auls<ptr/> of 2nd century
				<lb/>documents, and the last three weeks we have
			</ab>
			<pb n='2'/>
			<ab>
				<lb/>been engaged after one of the biggest of
				<lb/>the Roman mounds, with very good results,
				<lb/>especially with regard to 1st century
				<lb/>documents. Literary fragments have been
				<lb/>pretty frequent, but we should ^ <add rend='above'>have</add> liked
				<lb/>them to be larger. It is however
				<lb/>unlikely that any of the mounds that are
				<lb/>left will equal in that respect the two
				<lb/>which were finished last season. Nothing
				<lb/>Ptolemaic so far, but the mound which
				<lb/>we are going to next, and which yielded
				<lb/>some <persName ref='Q1407' n='Tiberius' key='Tiberius'>Tiberius</persName> documents in 1897, may
				<lb/>conceivably produce some. There is still
				<lb/>a great deal of work before us here, and
				<lb/>we shall want at least 2 more winters to
				<lb/>finish the Roman part properly. We have
				<lb/>built ourselves a house, <del rend='strikethrough'>and</del> which after

				<lb/>the confinement of tents is a great relief.
				<lb/>I wish you would come out next Christmas
				<lb/>and visit us. We had a delightful visit
				<lb/>from an <placeName ref='Q34217' n='Oxford' key='Oxford'>Oxford</placeName> friend, <persName ref='Q75747970' n='Munro, Arthur' key='Munro'>JAR Munro</persName>,<ptr/> about
				<lb/>a fortnight ago, and managed to have quite
				<lb/>a series of good finds <add rend='overwrite'>s</add>o<ptr/> that he departed
				<lb/>duly impressed. Our present mound has
				<lb/>turned up several quite pretty and
				<lb/>valuable small anticas—<ptr/> being the
				<lb/>first rubbish mound here which has ever
				<lb/>done such a thing.
				<lb/><persName ref='Q18206796' n='Jouguet, Pierre' key='Jouguet'>Jouguet</persName> has not yet appeared on the scene,
				<lb/>but his companion, <persName ref='Q937528' n='Lefebvre, Gustave' key='Lefebvre'>Lefebvre</persName>, is digging at
				<lb/><placeName ref='Q741742' n='Akoris' key='Tehneh'>Tehneh</placeName> about 40 miles S of <placeName ref='Q749187' n='Girga' key='Girga'>This</placeName>, and was
				<lb/>finding some 4th century papyri.<ptr/> <persName ref='Q1309598' n='Rubensohn, Otto' key='Rubensohn'>Rubensohn</persName>
				<lb/>is at <placeName ref='Q336098' n='Abusir' key='Abusir'>Abusir</placeName> near the <placeName ref='Q1399125' n='Faiyum Oasis' key='Faiyum Oasis'>Fayûm</placeName> looking
				<lb/>for cartonnage. Did I tell you that one
				<lb/>which he found there last year was dated in
				<lb/>the 12th year of Augustus ? That is much later
				<lb/>than any I have seen from the <placeName ref='Q1399125' n='Faiyum Oasis' key='Faiyum Oasis'>Fayûm</placeName>. <persName ref='Q220130' n='Petrie, Flinders' key='Petrie'>Petrie</persName>

				<lb/>big temple, but will not be able to effect
				<lb/>much till March or April owing to the water.
				<lb/>His assistant, <persName ref='Q5083028' n='Currelly, Charles Trick' key='Currelly'>Currelly</persName>, has been messing about
				<lb/>in the <placeName ref='Q1555240' n='Gurob' key='Gurob'>Gurob</placeName> cemetery, and found some more
				<lb/><add rend='overwrite'>p</add>apyrus<ptr/> cartonnage, but all in a condition
				<lb/>of powder.
				<lb/>The cattle-plague<ptr/> is raging round here: dead cows
				<lb/>and buffalos float<ptr/> past in our canal by scores:
				<lb/>they rather get on the nerves of <persName ref='Q573778' n='Hunt, Arthur Surridge' key='Hunt'>Hunt</persName> and the cook
				<lb/>but I, being out at the work all day, am able
				<lb/>to drink my tea without questioning its
				<lb/>flavour.
				<lb/>I hope you have had some proofs. We shall
				<lb/>leave <placeName ref='Q79' n='Egypt' key='Egypt'>Egypt</placeName> about March 4th and shall be back

				<lb/>suggestions, as soon as you can send them.
				<lb/>Love to <persName ref='Q2568204' n='Mahaffy, John Pentland' key='Mahaffy'>J.P.M.</persName>
