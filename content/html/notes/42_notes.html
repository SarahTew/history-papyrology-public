Unsurprisingly, the published accounts of the season omit Grenfell's sentiments about demotic. His attitude may well be observable on P.Tebt. frag. 10,751-10,756, a piece of cartonnage that was scratched to reveal the text underlying the paint and <i>gesso</i>; because demotic was exposed, the object seems to have escaped further attention.</p>

In his reference to the "Tebtunis ones," Grenfell must be thinking only of the "Menches" lot of the crocodile papyri, which was used by the embalmers shortly after 91 (cf. Verhoogt [n. 2] 49). At this advanced date (cf. n. 1) he was certainly aware of the later first-century texts (Verhoogt's "Batch 1"; pp. 17-18); cf. IE TCD MS 4323, no. 71 (27 July 1901).

It attributes "the usual damage to the mummies" to plundering in Antiquity, yet the large pit graves that Grenfell and Hunt were excavating suggest secondary burials; mummies interred in such might be expected to be "knocked about." "Ausgrabungen 1902" (n. 5) 182, adds, "The unplundered Ptolemaic tombs had nearly all been opened by us in 1900."</p>

        <p><a href="#ns-15">15. </a>Grenfell seems to be using "necropolis" here for the whole of al-Lāhūn, presumably on account of the locale's association with the pyramid of Senusret II. For Petrie's early excavations at the site (spring 1889, then 1889/1890), see W.M.F. Petrie, <i>Kahun, Gurob, and Hawara (London 1890), and Illahun, Kahun, and Gurob 1889-90</i> (London 1891); he would return to it in later years (cf. http://www.ucl.ac.uk/museums-static/digitalegypt/ archaeology/petriedigsindex.html, accessed 21 November 2016). Grenfell' s math is slightly amiss, and his critical tone in this portion of the letter is interesting in light of the high regard in which he seems to have held his mentor Petrie just a few years earlier; see T.M. Hickey and J.G.Keenan "At the Creation: Seven Letters from Grenfell, 1897," AnalPap 28 (2016) 351-382, letter no. IV.</p>

    <div class="note" id="n-16">
        <p><a href="#ns-16">16. </a>After excavating the crocodile cemetery, Grenfell and Hunt would turn their attention to these Ptolemaic tombs. "Excavations," 1901-1902 (n. 5) 4, indicates that they "had been extensively dug on behalf of the Museum in 1900 [cf. p. 4 of letter 1]. The tombs fell into two divisions, a later group ["2nd cent" above] on the south slopes of the hill on which was built the temple of Kahûn, and an earlier one ["3rd cent" above] on an adjacent rise to the west. In the former cartonnage was fairly frequent, but in all cases had been ruined by damp; from the latter however we succeeded in extracting a number of papyrus mummies, though here too the proximity of the cultivation had had in many cases an injurious effect upon their state of preservation." "Ausgrabungen 1902" (n. 5) 182, presents a discrepant account; it makes no mention of losses due to damp and echoes Grenfell's letter in its attribution of disappointing results to Egyptian activity: "These [tombs] had to a large extent been dug by natives, but one group had escaped and the cartonnage of most of the mummies was composed of papyrus." Though the 1900 Museum excavation had been overseen by a "native" inspector, it seems likely that both the letter and "Ausgrabungen 1902" are referring to illicit digging. Grenfell may, however, be lumping all non-Western activity at the site together.</p>
