      				<br>You will probably have been expecting
      				<br>for some time to hear from me, but I have waited
      				<br>to write until there was something good to report and
      				<br>if has taken till now . We are just entering on
      				<br>the 14th week of our excavations,<a href="#n-2" id="ns-2"><span class="note-ref"><sup>2</sup></span></a> the greater part
      				<br>of the time having been devoted to Ptolemaic cemeteries,
      				<br>but until the last week with extraordinarily
      				<br>bad luck. Not taht we have failed to find
      				<br>papyrus mummies; they have turned by the
      				<br>hundred. At <a class="wikidata" target="_blank" href="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1558783"><span class="placeName">Dimeh</span></a> there t<span class="del strikethrough">h</span>wo splendid
      				<br>cemeteries of them, one 3d cent B.C., the other other
      				<br>second, sometimes 10 or 15 in a tomb, but
      				<br>practically all had completely decayed__
      				<br>as seems inevitable save when the tombs are
      				<br>very shallow, the mummification very good and
      				<br>the desert of a particular kind.<a href="#n-3" id="ns-3"><span class="note-ref"><sup>3</sup></span></a> Down to a

      				<br>however we have been digging a fourth
      				<br>Ptolemaic cemetery which has got papyrus
      				<br>mummies, and though here too much has
      				<br>decayed we have raised about 20 out of it
      				<br>in good or very fair condition.<a href="#n-4" id="ns-4"><span class="note-ref"><sup>4</sup></span></a> So at least there
      				<br>is something solid, and, as we have still two
      				<br>more cemeteries near here (<span class="placeName">Rubayyat</span> where we are
      				<br>camped) to dig, we are, I hope, far from the end yet.<a href="#n-5" id="ns-5"><span class="note-ref"><sup>5</sup></span></a>
      				<br>But it will take a good deal to compensate us for
      				<br>the reallly herculean efforts we have made. It
      				<br>has been an exhausting season. While on the

      				<br>we had to  have everything, even fresh water, brought
      				<br>over by boat from the south side (1 1/2 hours)
      				<br>and owing to gales were occasionally left
      				<br>in the lurch, though we never actually had a
      				<br>water famine.<a href="#n-6" id="ns-6"><span class="note-ref"><sup>6</sup></span></a> The scene of the work varied
      				<br>from 2 to 7 miles [sic] distance from the camp
      				<br>which had to be pitched on the edge of the
      				<br>lake in a swamp.<a href="#n-7" id="ns-7"><span class="note-ref"><sup>7</sup></span></a> <a class="wikidata" target="_blank" href="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q573778"><span class="persName">Hunt</span></a> got a touch of

      				<br>off at 6.30 a.m. and dont return till 6.30. p.m.
      				<br>In order to get on fast, I have 130 workmen now
      				<br>partly Arabs, partly fellahîn, who tend to
      				<br>quarrel a good bit.<a href="#n-11" id="ns-11"><span class="note-ref"><sup>11</sup></span></a> One of the periodical fights occurred
