      				<br>How is <a class="wikidata" target="_blank" href="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q60205087"><span class="rs">P.P.III</span></a> getting on? I
      				<br>do hope it is on the point of coming out at last. We
      				<br>shall not lightly forgive you, if we have to do the
      				<br><span class="placeName">Hibeh</span> volume without its assistance. Kengin quite
      				<br>refused to believe when I arrived him that this
      				<br>winter would see its appearance.
      				<br>We managed to scramble through the texts of
      				<br><span class="rs">Tebtunis II</span> except the Dictys fragment) before we
      				<br>left. Some day you might look through the proofs,
      				<br>if you have time; but as the appendices have
      				<br>still to be written and the volume isnt to appear
      				<br>till far on in 1906, you had better see the reviewed
      				<br>proofs. We returned to <a class="wikidata" target="_blank" href="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q79"><span class="placeName">Egypt</span></a> to find everyone
      				<br>[???] scheming to get hold of some of the surplus set
      				<br>free by the <a class="wikidata" target="_blank" href="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q464399"><span class="rs">Anglo-French Agreement</span></a>. Those
      				<br>who have got posts are trying to get their salaries
      				<br>raised, those who havent are intriguing to
      				<br>obtain them. All the government &amp; Cmerts are
      				<br>being reenganiered, the museum among the rest.

      				<br>doubted. That sucking papyrologist, <a class="wikidata" target="_blank" href="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q937528"><span class="persName">Lefebvre</span></a>,
      				<br>has been made an inspector of antiquities, so
      				<br>will be practically lost which is a pity
      				<br>for he was at any rate capable of learning.
      				<br>Another English inspector or two is to be
      				<br>appointed, and a fly was thrown in our
      				<br>direction, but needless to say was rejected with
      				<br>scorn. It would take a very large bribe to
      				<br>make us desert papyri now, and certainly
      				<br>nothing could induce us to reside permanently
      				<br>in this country, which is charming enough in winter
      				<br>when one is far away by oneself, but is
      				<br>intolerable in the haunts of the tourist
      				<br>&amp; official. So we speed as swiftly as 
      				<br>possible back here, and proceeded with
      				<br>some qualms to knock down the [??lt]
      				<br>door &amp; window of our house which had been
      				<br>tricked up during our absence. To our
      				<br>relief not tenants more serious than
      				<br>spiders &amp; lizards (and 1 snake) appeared,
      				<br>and we were ^<span class="add above">able</span> to settle down at once

      				<br>The excavations proceed as before, with
      				<br>practically the same set of men, who are pretty
      				<br>expert by this time, though they require a
      				<br>good deal of looking after (especially with
      				<br>regard to the interecine disputes which
      				<br>inevitably arise about the ownership of a

      				<br>unaided now, for my headman of former
      				<br>years has been taken for a s?olding, and
      				<br>his successor has not lung power enough
      				<br>to cope with the rather turbulent inhabitants
      				<br>of this village. We have now had nearly
      				<br>a month's work and filled some 32 tons.
      				<br>The first three weeks were not very exacting.
      				<br>but the last week has produced some
      				<br>quite fine 3rd century documents. Literary
      				<br>fragments have been numerous in quantity
      				<br>&amp; rather poor in quality — the best being
