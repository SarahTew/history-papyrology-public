      				<br>My dear <a class="wikidata" target="_blank" href="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q76338502"><span class="persName">Smyly</span></a>,
      				<br>Very many thanks
      				<br>for the proof. You have done
      				<br>a tremendous lot and it is very
      				<br>kind of Barz to interest himself
      				<br>in them. Plase give him our best
      				<br>thanks. As to the ὦ φανεἱς χάρμα
      				<br>piece, our first thought was that it was
      				<br>cretis, but we abandoned it in deference
      				<br>to <a class="wikidata" target="_blank" href="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q77619"><span class="persName">Blass</span></a> ; and it is too late to alter now

      				<br>But your Phacthan idea in the
      				<br>epigram seems a great improvement,
      				<br>and we shall put that in all right. I
      				<br>am most pleased however with your
      				<br>remarks on 61 and 72 , in which you
      				<br>have gone a long way to clear up
      				<br>things . It is all the more welcome
      				<br>for because after 4 months abr???
      				<br>it is frightfully difficult to pick
      				<br>up all the details again which are
      				<br>necessary for a general thing, and I
      				<br>still contemplate Appendix I with
      				<br>horror. Appendix II (on <a class="wikidata" target="_blank" href="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q3350"><span class="persName">Eureg. II</span></a>)

      				<br>footnote and App. iii will
      				<br>have to be short . It is no good [got?]
      				<br>trying to get to the bottom yet
      				<br>with the very scanty evidence and we
      				<br>are under an obligation to get the
      				<br>book out as soon as possible. At present
      				<br>we are wrestling with the accounts,
      				<br>which are simply infernal.
      				<br>We are going to have an exhibition
      				<br>of our miscellaneous anticas (<span class="hi underline">not</span>

      				<br>have to go up to town about the end of

      				<br>we shall sit very tight here till
