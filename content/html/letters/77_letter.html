      				<br>My dear <a class="wikidata" target="_blank" href="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q76338502"><span class="persName">Smyly</span></a>,
      				<br>Many thanks for your
      				<br>letter. I agree with a great deal of
      				<br>what you say . χα + β no doubt means
      				<br>the equivalent of 2 silver dr. paid in
      				<br>copper, though I think this implies
      				<br>a more or less definite ratio between
      				<br>silver and copper, like the rates of 5 : 3
      				<br>in πυρός &amp; κριθή The obol need not
      				<br>be[en?] a coin, but I think it must
      				<br>have connected at any one moment a certain

      				<br>perphas in each year I by the government)
      				<br>and not <span class="hi underline">merely</span> a 1/6 of a silver dr,
      				<br>for otherwise I don't see how any
      				<br>sense is to be got out of saying that
      				<br>eg. 26 1/4 obols would be ac required
      				<br>for a [s later?]
      				<br>As the demotic 24 = 2/10 I have

      				<br>agree that it is a more translation of
      				<br>the Fr[ech] and hasnt anything to do with
      				<br>a ratio. According to <a class="wikidata" target="_blank" href="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q952574"><span class="persName">Griffith</span></a> it

      				<br>really any direct evidence b??ing on

      				<br>I do not quite understand what you say
      				<br>abou the dr. of 7 obols being 'due to
      				<br>the depreciation of gelen'. Do you mean
      				<br>there were 2 kinds of silver tetradrachme
      				<br>one worth 24 obols, the other 28? I have
      				<br>never met the dr. of 7 obols before
      				<br>the Roman period. Have you?
      				<br>As for the ἐπαλλαρή I cant help thinking
      				<br>that it must have something to do with
      				<br>the relative value of the metals ,because
