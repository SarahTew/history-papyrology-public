      				<br>Many thanks for so
      				<br>promptly sending your remarks, which
      				<br>we will consider carefully. The
      				<br>most serious are those about the 'regnal'
      				<br>years. The <a class="wikidata" target="_blank" href="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q4880851"><span class="placeName">Magdala</span></a> papyrus, which
      				<br>belongs to <a class="wikidata" target="_blank" href="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q39595"><span class="persName">Phillopater</span></a>, not <a class="wikidata" target="_blank" href="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q39602"><span class="persName">Eurgetes</span></a>,
      				<br>might be square with the your theory
      				<br>about the accension, but the P.P. on
      				<br>Part III Intro 8 seems to be, as you say,
      				<br>fetel. I had overlooked the month
      				<br>being Phemontis owing to the text
      				<br>being hidden away in the intro., but it

      				<br>surprises me rather that in the sp?te
      				<br>of it you should have [????] to the
      				<br>accension [view?] in P.P. III p. 331.
      				<br>At present I am disposed to abandon the
      				<br>'accension' theory altogether at the
      				<br>price of [???ing] about the appendix
      				<br>fearfully and to give up the
      				<br>question of [rubl??] [is/as?] hopeless. The γέον ἔτος
      				<br>on Pauni I of the Cenop Inscr. seems to
      				<br>me no use, for the regnal &amp; revenue
      				<br>years differ in months on both
      				<br>sides of the Sirius rising, cf. P.P. &amp;

      				<br>The Hibeh text suggest that the

      				<br>prefer [m??ing] Tholh, the beginning

      				<br>if that were possible. But I cant

      				<br>death (as <a class="wikidata" target="_blank" href="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q202790"><span class="persName">T.R.</span></a> seems to imply) is
      				<br>absurd. I have written to him to ask
      				<br>for an explanation.
