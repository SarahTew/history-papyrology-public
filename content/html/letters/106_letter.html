      				<br>My dear <a class="wikidata" target="_blank" href="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q76338502"><span class="persName">Smyly</span></a>
      				<br>You will ahve seen the news
      				<br>of Grenfell's departure. It came as
      				<br>a bit of a shock, as the latest
      				<br>report had been better, and he
      				<br>had lately written some postcards
      				<br>(perhaps you had one), and said
      				<br>he might/should? be expected in <a class="wikidata" target="_blank" href="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q34217"><span class="placeName">Oxford</span></a>.
      				<br>Well, he is coming, though not
      				<br>as he intended, poor chap. I
      				<br>dont think there was any longer
      				<br>a real hope of recovery, and so
      				<br>one can hardly regret t??e the?
      				<br>end has not been long delayed.
      				<br>The funeral is to take place
      				<br>here on Saturday.
      				<br>By his will, made in 1907, he
      				<br>bequethed to you the papyri ob-

      				<br>tained by him from <a class="wikidata" target="_blank" href="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1555240"><span class="placeName">Gurob</span></a> in 1894-5.
      				<br>I see that in your preference to
      				<br>"???le papyri from <a class="wikidata" target="_blank" href="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1555240"><span class="placeName">Gurob</span></a>" you say 
      				<br>that this customary had been
      				<br>"given" to you: did you use "give"
      				<br>in the full sense of the word, I
      				<br>wonder, and if so, was this gift
      				<br>subsequent to the will? You see,
      				<br>there is the question of proobate; if
      				<br>a valuation and duty can be
      				<br>escaped, so much the better of
      				<br>course.
      				<br>While there was still a possi-
      				<br>bility that <a class="wikidata" target="_blank" href="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q822668"><span class="persName">Grenfell</span></a> might one
      				<br>day return work, I deliberately
      				<br>????? aside the publication of
      				<br><span class="rs">Tebtunis III</span>, but now I shall
      				<br>have to face it though being
      				<br>in the mind ??? of other things I
      				<br>can do nothing for as present at
      				<br>any rate. I think that he
