      				<br>My dear <a class="wikidata" target="_blank" href="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q76338502"><span class="persName">Smyly</span></a>,
      				<br>I was away in town yesterday, but
      				<br>went to the <a class="wikidata" target="_blank" href="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q82133"><span class="orgName">Bodleian</span></a> today, the light being some
      				<br>of the best. Here are the answers to your questions
      				<br>(1) <span class="rs">P.P.II</span> vii line 7. I read εις τουτο for
      				<br>εκ τουγ <span class="hi underline">εις is quite certain</span>. Παυνι in
      				<br><a class="wikidata" target="_blank" href="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q2568204"><span class="persName">M</span></a>'s copy isnt right.
      				<br>line 11. the first symbol ῐ seems to represent
      				<br>αρουρα, the second 5 artabae
      				<br>13. I dont understand the symbol [symbol]. [cancellation?] 
      				<br>[symbol] is of course ιπ(παεχια) or some other
      				<br>derivative of ἵππος. But here the symbol seems
      				<br>to be Μ not Π with an l through the middle.
      				<br>(2) <span class="del overwritten">R</span><span class="rs"><span class="add overwrite">P</span> II.</span>viii col II verso the word before
      				<br>τιραχθηουσνται might be read as επει. In the
      				<br>next line <a class="wikidata" target="_blank" href="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q63413"><span class="persName">Wilcken</span></a> is, I think, right: it is γαρ.

      				<br>for the second half of Ν is probably only
      				<br>paint.
      				<br>As for επιδανε]ζεσθαι I agree with you
      				<br>ζ is unsatisfactory. ν]ιι̣σ̣α̣σθαι could be read
      				<br>but it is more like λεσθαι
      				<br>(3) II xiv (1a) 9.10 ως δ αν is right
      				<br>he made a muddle of it first. ανενενεγ
      				<br>καμενον will do. In this scrawl ον, ων
      				<br>and αν are indistinguishable, but συνταγον
      				<br>wont do. I am prepared to accept <a class="wikidata" target="_blank" href="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q2568204"><span class="persName">M</span></a>'s
      				<br>συντασσηι
      				<br>(1b) He seems to have written ουση
      				<br>first (perhaps he was going to unite ουσαν)
      				<br>and then scratched out ου &amp; put in ο at
      				<br>the top ἡ υγιης  is right. In the
      				<br>next line τιπο̣ς̣ τ̣α̣ θ̣εμελε της can be

      				<br>read. He certainly didnt write θεμελι<span class="hi underline">α</span>
      				<br>but it is possible he inserted [greek] over the
      				<br>line aftewrads, for the papyrus is rubbed
      				<br>just at that point
      				<br>(4) II xx col I 15 ο]θε̣ν is right.
      				<br>(5) xxii 14. about 10 lettesr are lost
      				<br>between χυραση̣ι̣ and απο. I cant see
      				<br>any ει.
      				<br>(6) XXVI (4) 2. the traces before ος will
      				<br>do for ημ. Διμναιου of course is
      				<br>right as in (3) 2,3 λι/μναιου του παρα
      				<br>in (7) I should read τα χαλκου
      				<br>[δε]αχμα[ς εξ[VERTICAL BAR] ηκοντα. But I dont
      				<br>understand lines 5 and 6 where <a class="wikidata" target="_blank" href="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q2568204"><span class="persName">M</span></a>'s readings
      				<br>must be wrong. I suspect a mention

      				<br>Ptolemais ὅρμου is by the way

      				<br>he only found about 25 papyrus mummies.
      				<br>We have parts of 120 (about 60 well
      				<br>preserved), so our collection ought to be
      				<br>very large, though the pectarels etc are in
